# textEditorPWA

## Description
This is a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques including IndexDB and local storage, that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application functions offline as well.
